<h3>Sam Fox - Athlete</h3>

<a class="img" title="Instagram" href="http://instagram.com/samfoxmjff" target="_blank"><img id="rfi-util-fb" style="margin-left: 9px;" src="https://www.michaeljfox.org/files/instagram_icon.png" border="0" alt="Instragram" width="17" height="17" /></a>
</div>
<p class="tourBio"><img class="bioImage" src="../images/content/pagebuilder/SamProf.jpg" border="0" alt="SamProf.jpg" width="540" height="540" />Over three months Sam will bike more than 5,000 miles and climb 49 different mountain peaks. This means Sam will ride an average of 120 miles and climb more than 1 peak every two days on the road. Sam has been planning this adventure for months, but come May 20, his focus will shift purely to biking, climbing, and meeting as many dedicated members of the PD community and volunteers as possible.</p>
<p class="tourBio">Prior to joining The Michael J. Fox Foundation staff in 2012, Sam was an avid Team Fox member dedicated to transforming his active lifestyle into a means to raise funds and awareness in support of his mother, Lucy, who lives with Parkinson&rsquo;s. Sam has completed two extreme challenges for Team Fox since 2011: a 60-day, 2,500-mile adventure run from Canada to Mexico on the Pacific Crest Trail, and a single day, 100-mile run from New York City to the tip of Long Island. The Tour De Fox promises to be his most challenging undertaking to date.</p>

<p class="tourBio"><img class="bioImage" src="../images/content/pagebuilder/MattBIO.jpg" border="0" alt="Matt Mitchell" width="536" height="536" />Matt will join the Tour crew in mid-July in Jackson, Wyoming. He'll join Sam on every climb and every bike ride for the final month of the journey, and he'll do all of this as a volunteer. Consider this a circuitous homecoming for Matt, who has been living in Finland for two years, but is a native of Vancouver, BC, the last stop on the Tour De Fox.</p>
<p>Matt has been a Team Fox member for 4 years. He is an accomplished endurance athlete and has run marathons for Team Fox all over the world. He got involved with Team Fox in 2010 to honor his father, who passed with Parkinson's in the same year. Matt, a familiar face to most in the Team Fox community, has come to define volunteer dedication to The Michael j. Fox Foundation. The Tour crew is lucky to have him on board.</p>

<p class="tourBio"><img class="bioImage" src="../images/content/pagebuilder/RyanBIO1.jpg" border="0" alt="Ryan Holmes" width="393" height="388" />Prior to joining The Michael J.
Fox Foundation staff in 2012, Sam was an avid Team Fox member dedicated to
transforming his active lifestyle into a means to raise funds and awareness in
support of his mother, Lucy, who lives with Parkinson&rsquo;s. In 2011, Sam&rsquo;s first
extreme adventure encompassed a 60-day run from Canada to Mexico, covering all
2,500 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. In 2012, Sam was back at it with his
&lsquo;Hamptons Hundred Miler&rsquo;: a one day, 100-mile run from New York City to the tip
of Long Island. </p>
<p class="tourBio">So why the extreme adventures? &ldquo;Physical challenges are a way
for me to feel closer to my Mom and, in a way, to understand her experience
with PD. It&rsquo;s clich&eacute;, but when I&rsquo;m tired and done, I just think about what my
Mom goes through every day and I find the motivation to take that next
step.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
