<p class="tourBio"><img class="getInvolvedImage" src="../images/content/pagebuilder/SamProf.jpg" border="0" alt="SamProf.jpg" width="200" height="100" />Over three months Sam will bike more than 5,000 miles and climb 49 different mountain peaks. This means Sam will ride an average of 120 miles and climb more than one peak every two days on the road. Sam has been planning this adventure for months, but come May 20, his focus will shift purely to biking, climbing, and meeting as many dedicated members of the PD community and volunteers as possible.</p>
